International Airlines, Operated Flights and Seats to and from Australia. Monthly data showing city, airline, route, country and region data. Do not sum this data unless Stops are set to zero. When Stops are set to zero, you can sum for Airline, Route, Inbound, Outbound and Total Australia. The data may include diversions. For diverted flights where seats are not sold to/from the diversion port, this data will overstate the available capacity to/from the diversion port. * Data does not include operations between Australian airports.
