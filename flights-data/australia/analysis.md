# International Traffic Analysis

We will perform a time series analysis for each location separately.

We're interested in all the locations listed in the dataset.

The data contains seasonality and we should account for it. There's a known external factor (COVID-19) that affected passenger counts during 2019-2021, but it rebounded since 2022.
